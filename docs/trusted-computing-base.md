# Trusted computing base

Overcenter measures safety complexity by **property-scoped trusted computing base (TCB)** rather than total repository size.

A TCB entry means: if this code is wrong in a relevant way, the named safety property may fail. Code outside that property's TCB is permitted to be buggy without invalidating the property, subject to the listed external assumptions.

The machine-readable policy is [`tcb-policy.json`](../tcb-policy.json). Reproduce the current report with:

```sh
npm run check:tcb
```

The report gives every trusted slice an exact path, symbol or whole-file boundary, source-line range, semantic LOC count, and SHA-256 fingerprint. Whole-file entries are intentionally conservative where the current analysis cannot yet prove a smaller sound slice.

## Properties

### Broker mutation safety

A broker-owned provider mutation must not cross the Overcenter effect boundary until current execution authority and exact claimed revision have been checked, an effect reservation has been durably appended, and no unresolved prior effect exists.

This property does **not** claim that an uncontrolled worker lacks ambient provider credentials. Physical effect confinement is a separate property with a different TCB.

### No false `DONE`

A run must not become `DONE` from worker assertion. `DONE` must arise from an admitted receipt whose authoritative observation proves the exact postcondition, with replay and historical realization reuse preserving those constraints.

### GitHub commit-status provider profile

The generic core depends on provider-specific facts being interpreted correctly. GitHub commit status therefore has a separately charged provider TCB covering repository identity, request dispatch certainty, response certification, pagination, and status-coordinate semantics.

## Budget rule

Each property has an explicit semantic-LOC ceiling. CI fails if the counted trusted slice exceeds it. The initial ceilings are intentionally loose while the first exact-head report establishes the baseline. They should then be tightened to the measured value so that future TCB growth requires an explicit policy change.

A LOC ceiling is not a proof. It is an architectural ratchet. The stronger evidence comes from combining this inventory with hostile tests, authority-flow analysis, exact-head CI, differential backends, and formal models.

## External assumptions

External assumptions are part of the TCB even though they have no repository LOC. The report keeps them visible instead of allowing a small source-code number to imply that SQLite, Node.js, the operating system, TLS, or provider API semantics are somehow untrusted or irrelevant.

## Direction

Prefer changes that:

1. remove trusted symbols or whole-file entries;
2. replace whole-file entries with mechanically justified symbol slices;
3. eliminate external assumptions;
4. move fallible orchestration and reasoning outside the TCB; and
5. preserve or strengthen the safety property while shrinking the trusted surface.

The target is not the smallest repository. It is the smallest piece of software that must be right.
